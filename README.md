# Chess Piece Identification using Python, TensorFlow, and NumPy

This project focuses on developing a chess piece identification system using Python, TensorFlow, and NumPy. The objective is to accurately classify and identify chess pieces given an image URL as input.

## Features

- Image Processing: The system processes the input image, extracts relevant features, and applies pre-trained models to make accurate predictions.
- High Accuracy: Through the utilization of TensorFlow and NumPy, the project achieves high accuracy in identifying various chess piece types.
- Easy Integration: The system can be easily integrated into other applications or websites through its modular and flexible design.

## Technologies Used

- Python: The core programming language used for implementing the system.
- TensorFlow: A powerful deep learning framework used to build, train, and deploy machine learning models.
- NumPy: A library used for efficient mathematical operations and manipulation of multi-dimensional arrays.

## Usage

1. Obtain the URL of the chess piece image you want to identify.
2. Provide the image URL as input to the chess piece identification system.
3. The system will process the image, apply the pre-trained model, and predict the type of chess piece in the image.
4. View the output or integrate the system's functionality into your application for further processing or analysis.

## Future Improvements

- Real-Time Identification: Enhance the system to perform real-time chess piece identification using a webcam or live video feed.
- UI Enhancement: Develop a user-friendly interface to visualize the identified chess pieces and display additional information.
- Dataset Expansion: Improve the accuracy and robustness of the system by collecting a larger and more diverse dataset.
- Multi-Piece Identification: Extend the system's capabilities to identify multiple chess pieces present in a single image.
